### Impact of Modern Code Review Practices on Software Quality

Software teams that use modern code reviewing tools like Gerrit are
quickly accumulating data about their code reviewing processes.  In
our research, we mine this code review data, connecting it with data
from other software repositories (e.g., version control, bug trackers)
to produce rich datasets.  We then analyze these datasets to study the
impact that code reviewing has on: (a) software release quality
(approximated using occurrences of post-release bugs) and (b) software
design quality (approximated using occurrences of design
anti-patterns).  In this talk, I will describe our approach to Gerrit
mining code review data and the results of some of our recent
empirical studies of the code reviewing processes of large open source
systems, such as Qt and OpenStack.

### GerritHub: 2 years in

[GerritHub](http://gerrithub.io/) launched 2 years ago, bringing
Gerrit to GitHub repositories. Learn more about how this is going.

### How I implemented SAML for Gerrit in one weekend

Most enterprises already have a single sign-on solution.
And Gerrit doesn't support SAML out of the box.

### Scaling Gerrit: active-active masters in a cluster

What does it take to get geographically distributed Gerrit masters?

*Patrick Renaud, Ericsson*

### Docker-ization of Gerrit

Packaging and Docker-ization for faster enterprise deployment.
